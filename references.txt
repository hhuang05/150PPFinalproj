Notes:
1. Seed of 9 into church program produces a condition number 907784.1057236332
2. To generate samples from a multivariate normal distribution, we need to find matrix A such that AA' = Sigma. However, for matrices that are ill-conditioned, Cholesky's decomposition might fail
3. Seed of 77 into church prog for 2x2 matrix produces 29246.728524478913

Experiment 2: 
- How long does it take to get to a solution? Can we get to a solution?

  Currently no, not able to get to a sample of W's that fit all the data
- How does the solution change based upon different values of the
  bound and the number of data items to condition
- Querying with MH and returning 100 sample, with lag = 100
- 40 runs

Experiment 3:
- How does changing the problem setup affect run-time?
1. Model all mushed together
2. Separate sampling of covariance and mu from w
- Looking for covariance matrices whose condition number is less than or equal to 100
- VectorNorm_bound less than or equal to 1
- Average over 40 runs, fitting 2 data points

Experiment: What does conditioning on condition number actually do for you?
- Probably need two norm here, but then what if you used infnorm
